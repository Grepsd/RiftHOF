This project allow everyone to share their parses.

The project is made by making two system working together :
- the rift combat log parser

The rift combat log parser parse a file, a return a set of data, from the damages done by someone to the heals received by spell and by caster.

The rift combat log parser only return encounter where a boss was hit.


The online viewer allow you to have a detailled view of a parse, it included charts and detailled view and tools such as actor performance comparator which allow you to compare what did a set of actor on an encounter dps, hps, crit rate for example.


We want this project to give you everything you could hopes to see on such a tool.
